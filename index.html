    <h2>What is Valorant?</h2>
    Riot Games's first ever FPS (first person shooter) game, Valorant, sister
    to Riot's most succesful franchise 'League of Legends', was released in
    2020. It is described as a 5v5 character-based tactical FPS where precise
    gunplay meets unique agent abilities. Two teams, defenders vs attackers,
    play to win 13 rounds on various maps. Valorant is the perfect blend
    between CSGO and Overwatch, blending exciting agent abilities with
    traditional gun-play to bring in new dimensional gameplays.There's much to
    learn, but fret not! Valorant is a fairly simple and user friendly FPS
    game that is quick to pick up. This guide will cover all the basics you
    need to know to get started!

        In a tatical 5v5 shooter game, each player will select an agent at the
        start of the round. You will either start on the side of the 'attackers'
        where you will push onto a site and plant the 'spike' (bomb) and prevent
        the 'defenders' from defusing it or killing everyone in your team. The
        attackers win by either letting the bomb explode or killing everyone in
        the defender's team. The defenders' objective is to diffuse the bomb if
        it has been planted or to kill everyone in the attacker team. First team
        to win 13 rounds wins the entire game. Each round, you only have 1 life
        and 100 health. There will be exceptions to these due to agent and
        shield variables (We will get into the details later).

        At the start of each round, you will need to buy a shield, a weapon and your agent's abilities. Everyone starts
        off with 800 and your economy will depend on your in-game performance. Essentially, the more enemies you kill
        and the more rounds your team wins, the more money you will have to buy better weapons.

    <h2> Gamemodes</h2>
    <p>There are various different gamemodes. Credit to https://www.ign.com/wikis/valorant/Valorant_Game_Modes.</p>

        <th>Gamemodes</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </thread>
      <tr>
        <td>Unrated</td>
        <td>Unrated is Valorant’s standard game mode which includes all of the game’s main features. Agent select
          (unique agent per player per team), buy phase (with the standard economy system), and standard gameplay are
          all involved. There are 12 rounds per half, and first to 13 rounds wins. Should the score tie 12-12, overtimes
          of 1 round per half can be played until 2 rounds are won in a row.</td>
      <tr>
        <td>Competitive</td>
        <td>Competitive is Essentially the main focus of Valorant. It has the same ruleset as Unrated but with higher
          stakes. Your personal performance, wins, and losses contribute to your rank rating. Check out the Competitive
          Guide for more details.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Spike Rush</td>
        <td>Spike Rush is meant to be a quick, bite-sized version of the Valorant experience. Agent select is still
          present, but buying is not. There are only 3 rounds per half where 4 rounds are required to win, and overtime
          is a single round. In this game mode, rounds are shorter and all players are given the same random loadout
          with all non-ultimate abilities immediately available. Certain orbs are placed across the map which provide
          you with various buffs to influence the round.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Deathmatch</td>
        <td>Deathmatch is a 12-player free-for-all on a random map. This is typically played as a “warm up” prior to an
          actual match, where you ensure your gunplay skills are on point before putting it to the test in an official
          match. This mode is used solely for shooting practice — agents and abilities are not relevant, Heavy Shields
          are automatically given, and all weapons are available. The match ends after a player reaches 40 kills or
          after 9 minutes passes.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Replication</td>
        <td>Replication is a casual game mode where everyone on a team plays as the same agent. There are 4 rounds in a
          half, first to 5 wins, and overtime is one round. Each new round refreshes your abilities and resets your
          weapons and shields. Regardless of round outcome, everyone receives 900 Creds on round 1, 2,400 on round 2,
          3,900 on round 3, and 6,000 on round 4.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Escalation</td>
        <td>Escalation is a casual 5v5 team deathmatch that features a random assortment of unconventional weapons. Each
          team receives a random “escalation tool” to start with that range from snowball launchers to paint shells.
          Getting enough kills as a team advances your team’s level up one — the team that finishes 12 levels wins.</td>
