      <h2>What is Valorant?</h2>
      Riot Games's first ever FPS (first person shooter) game, Valorant, sister
      to Riot's most succesful franchise 'League of Legends', was released in
      2020. It is described as a 5v5 character-based tactical FPS where precise
      gunplay meets unique agent abilities. Two teams, defenders vs attackers,
      play to win 13 rounds on various maps. Valorant is the perfect blend
      between CSGO and Overwatch, blending exciting agent abilities with
      traditional gun-play to bring in new dimensional gameplays.There's much to
      learn, but fret not! Valorant is a fairly simple and user friendly FPS
      game that is quick to pick up. This guide will cover all the basics you
      need to know to get started!

        In a tatical 5v5 shooter game, each player will select an agent at the
        start of the round. You will either start on the side of the 'attackers'
        where you will push onto a site and plant the 'spike' (bomb) and prevent
        the 'defenders' from defusing it or killing everyone in your team. The
        attackers win by either letting the bomb explode or killing everyone in
        the defender's team. The defenders' objective is to diffuse the bomb if
        it has been planted or to kill everyone in the attacker team. First team
        to win 13 rounds wins the entire game. Each round, you only have 1 life
        and 100 health. There will be exceptions to these due to agent and
        shield variables (We will get into the details later).
