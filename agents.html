    <h1> Agents </h1>
    <p>The composition of your team is crucial to your teams success on certain maps. Each agent has unique abilities
        that play a specific role. The four categories are split into duelists, initiators, sentinels and
        controllers.There are currently a total of 18 agents, each reigning from a different country. This table details
        the starting 5 agents you will have unlocked when you first start playing. To unlock other agents, you need to activate their contract and play more to earn XP.
        <br>
        Duelists: Duelists are self-sufficient fraggers who their team expects, through abilities and skills, to get
        high frags and seek out engagements first.
        <br>
        Initiators: Initiators challenge angles by setting up their team to enter contested ground and push defenders
        away.
        <br>
        Sentinels: Sentinels are defensive experts who can lock down areas and watch flanks, both on attacker and
        defender rounds.
        <br>
        Controllers: Controllers are experts in slicing up dangerous territory to set their team up for success.
