        <p>Agents have different variations of weapons, typically firearms, to cater to specific playstyles or
            metas.
            Weapons are separated by two categories, Sidearms and Primary weapons. Sidearms consists of pistols,
            whilst
            primaries include SMGs, shotguns, rifles, sniper rifles, and machine guns.Guns have limited amounts of
            ammo
            but come with reserve magazines. Bullets deal different amounts of damage depending on the gun, the body
            part they hit, and the distance between the shooter and the target. Guns are also affected by accuracy
            spreads. Most guns' first shot will have a spread value, meaning there is a possibility the shot fired
            will
            not make a perfect hit at the target under the player's crosshair. The higher the spread value, the more
            likely the shot will deviate from the crosshair. The only guns with with no spread for their first shot
            are
            the Guardian, Marshal, and Operator, and this only applies for the weapon's ADS or scoped mode.</p>



        <img class="tierlist" src="images/tierlist.webp" alt="tier list" title="rank list" style="width:30%">

        <div class="box">S-tier
            These are weapons that have an optimal cost/effectiveness ratio. They are typically the most commonly used
            guns for most maps on both offense/defense and the least situational weapons.

            A-tier
            These are weapons that are very powerful but a little more situational than S-Tier. They usually have a
            slightly lower cost/effectiveness ratio and may not work too well on either offense or defense on certain
            maps.

            B-tier
            These are weapons that can be strong in certain situations but also tend to have a disadvantage against
            their competitors in many situations. You usually only run them at very specific parts of the map and they
            can vary in performance based on attacking or defending.

            C-tier
            These are weapons that are very situational and rarely worth picking up. They are they rarely offer an
            advantage over their competition.
